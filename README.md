# CS2_TextUtility-Ibrahim-Anas
# This project is a simple text utility library built in C++ as part of our CS2 lab assignment at the American University in Cairo.
# It provides a set of functions for **basic text processing using only C-style strings** (`char[]` and `char*`). The code is modularized across multiple files and supports building via **g++** or **CMake**.


## üìÅ Project Structure
* text_utility.cpp // The implementaion of the functions
* text_utility.h // Including all header files we need here
* main.cpp // To test the project
* CMakeLists.txt // CMake build configuration


##  Features
